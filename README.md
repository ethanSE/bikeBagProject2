## Description

This project was created to practice React and redux. It allows users to upload a photo of their bike, specify custom dimensions and scale, and receive a pattern for cutting out the fabric. It ouputs an SVG file which can be fed to a laser cutter.

This project was created to demonstrate what a front end for allowing customers to customize the dimensions of a bike frame bag could look like. Many current custom manufacturers require customers to fill out complicated forms with many fields for different measurements. An interface such as this could help reduce the work done by users as well as by manufacturers. In a real-world scenario a customer's input would create a work order with specifications about the custom item. The manufacturer could simply download the plans, batch orders, and optimize fabric usage to reduce waste.

This project is still in development and I have a couple of other deadlines to meet in the near future.
