## Description

This project was created to practice React and redux. It allows users to upload a photo of their bike, specify custom dimensions and scale, and receive a pattern for cutting out the fabric. It ouputs an SVG file which can be fed to a laser cutter.

This project was created to demonstrate what a front end for allowing customers to customize the dimensions of a bike frame bag could look like. Many companies exist that make made to order custom frame bags and their websites are often not particularly user friendly or engaging. They often require users to fill out complicated forms.
