## Description

As a cycling enthusiast and bike commuter I have been interested in custom bike frame bags for a while and have sewn several of my own design. 


I have researched the custom made-to-order bike frame bag market and have noticed several areas in which tech could help to connect customers with products.


1. Many companies' websites are out-dated and require users to fill out complex forms with several meauserments to place custom orders. On several companies' websites the call to action directs users to email the company to begin the communication process. This is not particularly engaging.

2. There appears to be a lot of room for automation in the design and construction process that could reduce time and material costs.


My solution to this problem is a web-based application in which:

1. A user can visit a company's webiste, upload a picture of their bike, establish a scale, and input a custom shape.   
This makes getting the process started for the customer much easier.

2. On confirmation and payment a work order with customer information and a customized design is stored in the backend. 

3. An employee can access orders through a seperate application, review orders, download plans, and batch multiple orders to perform cutting stock optimizations thereby increasing efficiency and reducing material waste.


In its current state this project:  
  • demonstrates what the front end of such an application could look like  
  • provides a directed user experience  
  • generates an svg file with real-world units which can be downloaded by the user  
  
  output is set up to be read by software that will optimize fabric usage    
  For and awesome open-source program to solve the 2D cutting stock problem with irregular polygons check out https://deepnest.io/ by Jack Qiao.

Goals for this project include:   
  • icorporate an aws backend that stores order information including bike photo, dimensions, user information, order status, etc.
  • create application that would allow the business to view information, overlay user input and user's photo for manual verification of user input prior to construction and allow admin to tweak design before production or contact customer
